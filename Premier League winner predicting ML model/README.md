# EPL Match Winner Prediction for 2024-25 Season

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the winners of English Premier League (EPL) matches for the 2024-25 season. By leveraging historical data from the 2022-2024 seasons, a prediction model has been developed to forecast match outcomes with a primary focus on determining the match winners. The model utilizes various match-related features such as team performance and statistics, match conditions to provide accurate predictions, helping fans, analysts, and stakeholders make informed decisions about upcoming EPL matches.

## Data Scrapping
The Project required realtime match data from the English Premier League and was extracted using HTML from Fbref. Data scraping was one of  important part of this project.

#### Extracting HTML links

#### Website Table

The data collection process was carried out in two key phases to ensure a comprehensive dataset for model training and evaluation:

### 1. Initial Data Scraping

- **Objective:** Start by scraping data for a single EPL team to develop and test the data extraction script.
- **Details:** The initial scraping script was designed to gather match data, team statistics, and performance metrics for one team. This step allowed for validation of the data extraction process and ensured accuracy.


#### Scraped Mancity/Oneteam Data

### 2. Iterative Data Collection

- **Objective:** Expand the data collection to cover all 20 EPL teams over two seasons (2022-2024).
- **Details:** After successfully validating the initial script, it was adapted to loop through all 20 teams. This automated approach ensured that data was collected systematically for each team across the specified seasons.
- **Process:**
  - **Loop Implementation:** Automated the scraping process to gather data for each team, iterating through a predefined list of EPL teams.
  - **Data Aggregation:** Combined data from all teams into a single dataset, ensuring consistency and completeness across the two seasons.

### Handling Site Access Issues
During the scraping process, the script encountered issues with being blocked from the site due to continuous scraping. To mitigate this issue, the following solution was implemented:

- **Issue:** The website's anti-scraping measures resulted in temporary blocks due to the high frequency of requests.
- **Solution:** A time limit was added to the loop to introduce delays between requests. This approach helps to:
  - **Prevent Overloading:** Reduce the risk of being blocked by spreading out requests over time.
  - **Respect Site Policies:** Adhere to the website's terms of service regarding request frequency.

#### Implementation of Time Limit

**Delay Interval:** Added a time delay (60 seconds) between consecutive requests.

Beautiful Soup and pandas were used to extract and ro formulate the data into pandas frame. The dataset encompasses various performance metrics and statistics from the previous two EPL seasons.

## Data Processing

1. **Data Cleaning:** The raw data was cleaned and pre-processed with Pandas to ensure consistency and accuracy for modeling.

## Model Building

The prediction model was developed using Scikit-Learn with the following classifiers:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
The data set were split into two
    - Training set < 01.01.2024
    - Test set > 01.01.2024

Initially, the model achieved an accuracy of 60% in predicting match outcomes, with a specific winner prediction accuracy of 47%.

## Model Improvement

To improve the prediction of specific match winners, the following steps were undertaken:
1. **Error Analysis:** Measurement of model errors to identify areas for improvement.
